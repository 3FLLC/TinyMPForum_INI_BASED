Installation
------------

Your web server needs to have mod_celerity.so registered in the conf.d
folder. Then you need to have celerity started and running (it works
much like coldfusion, or httpd itself - it runs as a standalone daemon).

For this open source script, simply unzip the archive into the folder
you wish to use as the URL, for example <your_domain>/forum/ then make
a directory in your root folder called forum, put the archive into that
folder, and unzip it. To test, simply open a browser and point it to
<your_domain>/forum/, and the starter environment is up and running. It
really is that easy!

Inspiration
-----------

This project was inspired by the old 2006 PHP product by Ralph Capper
the author of TinyPHPForum. Unfortunately for Ralph, TPF was one of his
teething projects and it was riddled with security issues. This rewrite
of his code and design attempts to squash all of those issues by better
security practices and htaccess control. It isn't like there really is
anything stored on these type of sites to attack hackers, but, when a
hacker has teeth somewhere they usually start with web scripts.

Directory Structure
-------------------

../             root domain of your server (remember we are a folder!)
./emoticons/    the root folder for all support emoticon images
./forums/       the root folder for all posts (we are file-based!)
./i18n/         the root folder for all languages
./images/       the root folder for all graphics, skins, and avatars

Filenames
---------

./.htaccess     the file that Denys web server access to all ini files
./index.p       the main script for the whole TMPF product
./users.ini     the main user database
./forums.ini    the main forums database

Filenames in i18n
-----------------

en              the English key=value pair
es              the Spanish key=value part
etc...

Filenames in forums
-------------------

1..xxxx         each folder, is a separate forum see forums.ini

1..xxxx         in each of these numbered forum folders you will find
                a numbered folder, which is for each main forum topic.
                e.g. ./forums/1/1/ = forum #1, topic #1

1..xxxx         in each of these numbered topic folders you will find
                one or more files. Based upon configuration all files
                are compressed using built-in compression call or if
                compression is disabled and permalink is enabled for
                this topic the files are stored as .html files and
                the URLs are /forums/1/1/topic%20title.html instead
                of the /?forum=1/1/1 for the compressed version.

1..xxxx.ini     in each of the numbered topic folders is a userid.ini
                file - used as a high message watermark. So the system
                actually knows per topic and thread the last message
                the user has read.

topic.ini       in each of the numbered topic folders is a topic.ini
                file - used for total messages, optional threading and
                permissions.

Admin Profile
-------------

Use the built in account:

Username: admin
Password: admin

Either change the password, or create an account then make it admin using
the account above.

Note: Remember to check the 'admin' box if you edit an admin profile, or
the admin functionality will be lost.

If you lose all admin accounts this way (oops!) then edit any account's
file (./users.ini) and change the value for 'password=' to:
**5E884898DA28047151D0E56F8DC6292773603D0D6AABBDD62A11EF721D1542D8**
then save and log in, your password is now password. You can run the command
line utility p.p (mp p.p your_new_password) and paste it in as above.
